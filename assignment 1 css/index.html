        <p>I need another story<br>
            Something to get off my chest<br>
            My life gets kinda boring<br>
            Need something that I can confess<br>
            <em class="sleeves">'Til all my sleeves are stained red</em><br>
            From all the <em class="truth">truth</em> that I've said<br>
            <em class="honestly">Come by it honestly I swear<br></em>
            <em class="wink">Thought you saw me wink, no<br></em>

        <p>
            So tell me what you want to hear <br>
            Something that will light those ears <br>
            I'm sick of all the insincere <br>
            So I'm gonna give <em class="special">all my secrets away</em> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            This time <br>

            My God, amazing how we got this far<br>

            Who's driving shiny big black cars<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And every day I see the <em class="news">news</em><br>
            All the <em class="problems">problems</em> that we could solve<br>
            And when a situation <em class="rises">rises</em><br>
            Just write it into an album<br>
            Send it straight to <em class="gold">gold</em><br>
            But I don't really like my flow, no
